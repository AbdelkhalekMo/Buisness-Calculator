i have a small factory that make products from wood and acrylic and i want to make a small claculations system for pricing the products according to its type and size and if there is some additional accessories with additional price.
i want first to make a simple and organized page with beatiful colors.
first i want to to pick one of two types which are acrylic or wood then the employee will put the size of the product (length and width) with cm, then we will make drop list that have many additional things and when he pick one of them it will be added to a box with its name and its price will be added to the price in same time to let the employee see the price dynamically and also when he pick some thing else from the drop list it will be added to the box of additional accessories and the price will increase dynamically and these additional things that will be added tot he box will have option to delete it and when  it deleted its price will decrease from the total price of the product.
the pricing system will be (5 L.E pounds for each 10cmx10cm piece ) like if the product is wooden and its size 30x30 it will be 45 and so on and we will take the ceeling of the size like if the size is 35x35 it will be like 40x40 because the least unit of pricng is 10cmx10 cm and the same for the acrylic but the price will be 4 L.E pounds for each 5cmx5cm like if the product size is 20x30 it will be 96 and according to ceeling if size is 12x12 it will  be like 15x15 and if size is 18x23 it will be like 20x25 and so on and after that will be option to chose (with frame) and if he chose it it will be added to the box with the additional items and its price will be according to the size of the main product, and its price will be 4 pounds for each 5cmx5cm with both products type. and at the beginning let the addition items be (Names with price 10 pounds, cutted sentence with price 10 pounds, engraved sentence with 15 pounds, fingerprints places with 10 pounds, acrylic box with 50 pounds) 
plz make a clean and organized code to let me make edits to prices or adding some additional accesories in easy way and take care of mobile scrreen size in responsive because most usage of this page will be from the mobile phones.
and at the end make a place to open a specific pdf page that is placed on google drive and will open directly if we cliked on that photo in our page.

make the code with bootstrap and with arabic language in arabic form
